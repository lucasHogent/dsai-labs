    "Probability (P) is the likelihood of an event occurring and is expressed as a fraction or a decimal between 0 and 1.\n",
    "The probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Addition Rule:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If two events are mutually exclusive (they cannot occur simultaneously), the probability of either event occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[$P(A$ $\\text{ or }$ $B$) = $P(A) + P(B) $\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiplication Rule:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If two events are independent (the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other), the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.\n",
